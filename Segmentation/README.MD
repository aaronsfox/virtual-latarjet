# Segmentation Process

Segmentation of the CT data was performed in Materialise Mimics Research v21.0. The major tool used was the threshold feature to create masks of the bony elements of the scans. Mimics splitting tool was used to extract indiviual parts. The various filling tools were used to fill out the masks and create subsequent complete surface parts of the relevant bodies. Manual refinement of the masks was performed using the other editing tools (e.g. threshold painting) to finalise the parts.

TODO:
- Add details of bodies extracted and process to do so.
