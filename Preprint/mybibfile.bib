The incidence of shoulder dislocation is increasing.1 Recurrence is common and occurs in as many as 67{\%} of cases.2 Patients often mention a painful, weak arm and a shoulder that readily dislocates with trivial movements. These disabling symptoms can lead to multiple hospital admissions, decreased ability to participate in high level activities, fewer employment opportunities, and a reduction in overall health.3 The “unstable shoulder��O has therefore become a relatively common problem seen in primary healthcare, with a reported incidence rate of 2.8{\%}.4 The aim of this review is to provide a simple framework for the clinical assessment, investigation, and treatment of the unstable shoulder for non-specialists and to highlight key patient groups that benefit from early specialist input. Sources and selection criteria We searched Medline and the Cochrane library using the terms “shoulder instability��O, “shoulder dislocation��O, “clinical assessment of shoulder instability��O, and “treatment of shoulder instability��O. Only articles published in English were included. Data were primarily collated from observational studies, case series, and randomised controlled trials. How does a shoulder become unstable?

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injuries are common in all professional football codes (including soccer, rugby league and union, American football, Gaelic football, and Australian football).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPURPOSE: To report the epidemiology of injuries in the Australian Football League (AFL) from 1992-2012 and to identify changes in injury patterns during that period.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The AFL commenced surveying injuries in 1992, with all teams and players included since 1996. An injury was defined as "any physical or medical condition that causes a player to miss a match in the regular season or finals (playoffs)." Administrative records of injury payments (which are compulsory as part of salary cap compliance) to players who do not play matches determined the occurrence of an injury. The seasonal incidence was measured in units of new injuries per club (of 40 players) per season (of 22 matches).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were 4492 players listed over the 21-year period who suffered 13,606 new injuries/illnesses and 1965 recurrent injuries/illnesses, which caused 51,919 matches to be missed. The lowest seasonal incidence was 30.3 new injuries per club per season recorded in 1993, and the highest was 40.3 recorded in 1998. The injury prevalence (missed matches through injury per club per season) varied from a low of 116.3 in 1994 to a high of 157.1 in 2011. The recurrence rate of injuries was highest at 25{\%} in 1992 and lowest at 9{\%} in 2012 and has steadily fallen across the 21 years (P {\textless} .01). The most frequent and prevalent injury was hamstring strain (average of 6 injuries per club per season, resulting in 20 missed matches per club per season; recurrence rate, 26{\%}), although the rate of hamstring injuries has fallen in the past 2 seasons after a change to the structure of the interchange bench (P {\textless} .05). The rate of knee posterior cruciate ligament injuries fell in the years after a rule change to prevent knee-to-knee collisions in ruckmen (P {\textless} .01).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Annual public reporting (by way of media release and reports available freely online) of injury rates, using units easily understood by laypeople, has been well received. It has also paved the way for rule changes with the primary goal of improving player safety.},

@article{Kavaja2012,
abstract = {Hypothesis: The purpose of the study was to establish radiologic and clinical occurrence of glenohumeral arthrosis after arthroscopic Bankart repair. Materials and methods: Between January 1994 and December 1998, an arthroscopic Bankart repair was performed in 187 patients at our institution. We were able to assess clinical and radiologic glenohumeral arthrosis in 72 of the 101 patients who met the inclusion criteria (74 shoulders) (71{\%}) after a 13-year follow-up. An additional 9 patients were interviewed by telephone. Radiologic arthrosis was evaluated with the Samilson-Prieto classification and clinical arthrosis with an arthrosis-specific quality-of-life questionnaire (Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder test). In addition, functional impairment was assessed with the Constant score and subjective satisfaction with a questionnaire. Results: Radiologic arthrosis was diagnosed in 50 of 74 shoulders (68{\%}), with 40 (80{\%}) of them classified as mild. The mean score on the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder questionnaire was 280 points (85{\%} of the best possible score), which is considered relatively good. The mean Constant score was 78 points, and 75{\%} of the patients were extremely satisfied or satisfied with the final results of operative treatment. Discussion: The radiologic evaluation and self-assessment of the patients imply that the incidence of glenohumeral arthrosis after arthroscopic Bankart repair is quite common but the symptoms are generally mild and comparable to nonoperative treatment. Conclusion: Arthrosis rarely causes more than minor subjective symptoms or a minor objectively perceived disadvantage during 13 years' follow-up. {\textcopyright} 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Optimal surgical management of anterior shoulder instability remains controversial. There is a need to assess the most recent trends for primary and revision shoulder stabilization surgery using a national database significantly larger than those previously utilized. HYPOTHESIS Most shoulder stabilization procedures are performed arthroscopically. Examining revision procedures, we hypothesized that open procedures would result in decreased revision stabilizations compared with arthroscopic procedures and that most revision procedures would be open Bankart or bone transfer procedures regardless of the index procedure technique. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS The MarketScan Database was searched using International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to identify patients who underwent any shoulder stabilization procedure between 2008 and 2012. Regression analysis was used to evaluate trends between patient groups. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to identify differences in trends seen yearly. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to compare the likelihood of undergoing a revision stabilization procedure. RESULTS A total of 66,564 shoulder stabilization procedures were identified from 2008 through 2012: 60,248 arthroscopic stabilization procedures (90.5{\%}) and 6316 open stabilization procedures (9.5{\%}), including 1623 bone block procedures. Arthroscopic stabilization procedures increased in total number and percentage of all procedures in each year of the study. Bone block procedures increased in number each year, although other open procedures decreased during the study period. Males underwent more stabilization procedures, while patients between the ages of 10 and 19 years were most likely to undergo any procedure. Patients who underwent bone block stabilization were significantly less likely to undergo a second stabilization procedure during the study period when compared with open Bankart repair (OR, 0.582; 95{\%} CI, 0.405-0.836;P{\textless} .05) and arthroscopic Bankart repair (OR, 0.587; 95{\%} CI, 0.418-0.824;P{\textless} .05). No statistically significant difference in revision stabilization was seen when comparing arthroscopic versus open Bankart repair (OR, 0.934; 95{\%} CI, 0.863-1.139). CONCLUSION Although the number of arthroscopic shoulder stabilization surgeries continues to increase, our data show a consistent increase, not seen in prior studies, in the number of bone block procedures. Contrary to some studies, there was no significant difference in the likelihood of a second procedure between patients initially undergoing arthroscopic compared with open Bankart repair.},
