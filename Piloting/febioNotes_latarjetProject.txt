changed cartilage materials to isotropic elastic in line with Klemt et al.
neo-Hookean implementation in FEBio is compressible, which disagrees with the incompressible of Walia et al.

tied-elastic with head fails - auto penalty on; penalty 100, gap tolerance 0.01, augtol 0.1
	> changed gap tolerance to zero? get some fail to converge messages and reducing time steps and fails
	
	>> could be the tied-elastic contact or it could be the change in material, given I thought this contact worked before?
	
tied facet to facet with head as primary, augtol 0.1, penalty 100 fails
	> swapped primary to secondary, seems to progress better, still has time step issues, and fails...
	> turning augmented lagrangian on results in a seemingly shitty outcome
	> a low penalty on tied face to face allows the sim to progress, but only because the spjhere projects through the cartilage, and then it fails
	
tied facet to facet contact with a 1000 penalty and changing back to neo-Hookean material progresses through the simulation better
	> this probably produces the cartilage stretching though and some surface penetration, and the material is 'compressible' (not like in Walia et al.)
	> the cartilage travels with the head but the elements get compressed and squished - likely because of compress-ability
	> tested out a Mooney-Rivlin with 10/20/1000 properties -- the cartilage moves well with the head and doesn't squish at all!
		>> From FEBio manual -- This material model uses a standard displacement-based element formulation, so care must be taken when modeling materials with nearly-incompressible material behavior to avoid element locking. For this case, use the Mooney-Rivlin material described in Section 4.1.2.8.
	> When C2=0 , Mooney-Rivlin reduces to an uncoupled version of the neo-Hookean constitutive model.
		>> tested this...seems to produce similar resul
	> There is an incompressible neo-Hookean available in the uncoupled elastic materials, with shear and bulk modulus parameters (don't know what these are?)
		>> tested this with 10 and 0.4 applied respectively -- get a similar response to the normal neo-Hookean
			>>> bumped up to 1000 each for the parameters -- get a response much more like the Mooney-Rivlin where the cartilage doesn't squish!
			>>> Walia et al. has equations for two constants (C and D), likely the shear and bulk modulus
				>>>> Using these equations gives small numbers, when input to shear and bulk modulus this results in the cartilage stretching rather than translating
				>>>> Multiply these by 100 (i.e. ~100 and ~800) & you get a better result
					>>>>> Units in FEBio being dimensionless? Different to the Walia et al. paper? mm vs. m would be 1000 factor...
					>>>>> Settled on 1000 and 8000 as these for testing purposes, seeing as these gives a quite stiff surface
	> Added the same material properties to glenoid cartilage and added same tied face to face contact interface between this and glenoid
		>> Things work as expected, head penetrates glenoid cartilage as there is no contact interface
	> Added a sliding face to face contct surface between humeral and glenoid cartilage -- augtol 0.1, penatly 1000, auto penalty off, laugon off, humeral primary surface
		>> things progress well through early simulation, starts to struggle around 0.8-0.9 likel when cartilage contact occurs, solver adjusts time step
			>>> wouldn't converge, so stopped to see what was happening -- glenoid cartilage is receiving contact and compressing, but has some decent penetration
		>> cranked up penalty to 1e+07 and re-ran
			>>> can't deal with the contact -- maybe try auto penalty with 1000 penalty?
				>>>> 1000 too high, auto penalty with 10 penalty also fails
		
	
	
tied node on facet seems to produce the same results
	
the new isotropic elastic material doesn't seem to want to move?

sliding face to face, rigid as primary, auto penalty on, penalty at 100, augtol 0.01, other default settings
	> seems to be similarly shitty outcome
	
	
if cartilage doesn't want to move with rigid connection, perhaps apply body load to cartilage?
	> don't know if this will work any better or solve the contact problem
