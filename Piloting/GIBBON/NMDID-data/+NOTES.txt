- Thin H/N/UPEXT CT scan used from NMDID dataset
- Segmentation done the same way as standard segmentation README
- Didn't smooth scapula before porting to 3matic - smoothed the humerus in Mimics to remove some noise and tiny islands
- In 3matic, smoothed scapula with 0.7 factor; ran adaptive remesh with target length of 0.5 and maximum length of 1.0, while maintaining surface contours
- Did the same to humerus as with scapula in 3matic
- this gives quite a fine mesh, but we can adapt from this with mesh convergence
- fit sphere to humeral head ('HeadSphere') by marking triangles (copied and kept these triangles)
- created point at head sphere centre for GH joint centre
- marked epicondyle points EL and EM on humerus
- marked AA, TS and AI on scapula
- marked SGT and IGT on scapula
- fit a plane to marked triangles on the glenoid surface ('GlenoidPlane'); copied these traingles to retain as separate part
- used created plane to assist in identifying the 'DeepGlenoidPoint' on the glenoid surface
- exported Humerus and Scapula as ASCII STL files
- exported the landmarks as 'Curves and Primitives' as separate .xml files

- next steps done in Matlab...see 'testAnalysisCode.m'
