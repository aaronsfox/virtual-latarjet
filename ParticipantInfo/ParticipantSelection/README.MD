The metadata files included within this folder come from the [New Mexico Decedent Image Database (NMDID)](https://nmdid.unm.edu/) and include the individuals from a search that focused on ages 18 - 40 years old, and those who had 'Activities' listed.

The Python code contained within this folder (i.e. 'participantFinder.py') filters through this participant meta-data to provide a list of relevant participants that meet the study inclusion criteria.

***TODO: add specific inclusion criteria from code***
